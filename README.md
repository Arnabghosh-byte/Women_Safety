Women Safety
A SOS app I created to promote Women Safety. It's a Java-based Android App developed in Android Studio.


Setup
Download and install Android Studio.

Download or clone the repository.

Open the project in Android Studio.

Connect your device to your PC via USB/Wireless Debugging.

Click Run App to install it on your device.

How To Use
Open the app, give it all the permissions (Contacts, Location, Messages & Background Restrictions). The app might crash; just restart it.

Click Add Emergency Contact and select your emergency contacts who you wish to alert.


Make sure your device location is enabled.

Shake your phone vigorously 3 times. The device vibrates to confirm that the message is sent.

The SMS is sent from your phone. If location is enabled, a Google Maps link is attached; else it sends a simple alert message.
